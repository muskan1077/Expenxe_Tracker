Steps to push changes to the master branch directly
  Check the files edited by command **git status**
  If all changed files need to be committed, proceed with command **git commit -a -m "commit message"**
  Else if some files need to be committed, add each file by command **git add filePath** 
       followed by a commit command **git commit -m "commit message"**
  Push the changes to master by command **git push origin master**
